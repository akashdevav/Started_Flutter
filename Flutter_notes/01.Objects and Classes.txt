-> Objects:- 
	~ Dart is fully based on Objects.
	~ Everything in the flutter comes at objects.
	eg: widgets, datatypes like int,string,float,bool -> at the end all must be called as objects.

-> Class in flutter:-
	Simply the classes are used in the flutter is to obtain same set of conditons or functionality or configuration that can takes to n number of multiple places.
	In other hand we can call the classes to multiple places.

Defining a class in flutter have some certain format that should be followed:
	~ use class key word followed by the class name which is users convinience.
	~ also can be extended by some widgets like statefullwidget or statlesswidgets.
	~ followed by curley brackets.

eg: class class_name extends statelessWidget {
	
	};

-> Constructor:-
	
	~ within the class we have to define the constructor, which gives a more configurations to the class.
	There is some format that has followed by define a constructor:

	eg: class_name(key):{super.key:key} ->in shortform->	class_name({super.key});

	Here, {super.key} represents -> collecting metadatas from the classes and objects.
	~ followed by some attributes like @override - for the purpose for metadata.

	~ And in the class start with a function called build function or method which returns the widget.
	
	eg: widget build(context){
		return _widgets_
		};
	~ Here, context is the parameter - which defines metadata of class.
